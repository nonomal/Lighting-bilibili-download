# Quickstart

bilix offers a simple command line interface, so open the terminal and start downloading now!

## Batch download

Batch download entire anime series, TV shows, movies, and UP submissions... just replace the `url` in the
command with the web link of any video in the series you want to download.

Head over to bilibili and find one to try (like [this](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JE411g7XF)),
`bilix` will download the files to the `videos` folder in the current directory of the command line, which is automatically created by default.

```shell
bilix get_series 'url'
```

`get_series` is powerful, as it automatically recognizes and downloads all videos in a series.

::: info
* What is a series: For example, all parts of a multi-part submission, all episodes of an anime or TV show.
* Some URLs containing parameters need to be wrapped in `''` when used in the terminal.
The Windows cmd does not support `''`, but you can use PowerShell or Windows Terminal as an alternative.
